It has never been more important than it is right now to keep up with the digital growth and to have online organization tools.
I wanted to create a fast and easy way to organize church database , access information and store information. 

Try it now: https://project-2-mixtape.herokuapp.com/

Church Manager is a Online Management Application built on Spring MVC, It has a simple interface for Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting church members. I want the user to be solely focused on their members, and so i designed a easy to use, mobile-friendly website for just that. 


```
AS A pastor/ Church worker I want to manage my church members
